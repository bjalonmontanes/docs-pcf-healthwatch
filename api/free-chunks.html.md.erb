title: Configuring Free Chunk Sizes
owner: Pivotal Healthwatch

This topic describes how to use the Pivotal Healthwatch API to retrieve and configure [Available Free Chunks of Memory](../metrics.html#free-memory-chunks) and [Available Free Chunks of Disk](../metrics.html#free-disk-chunks).

Currently, two main types of free chunk configurations are supported: Global and Deployment-specific. Through this API, consumers can do the following:

- View current free chunk configurations
- Update the Global free chunk size for memory and disk
- Create deployment-specific free chunk configurations
  - Applicable for customers isolating Compute (Diego Cells) into Isolation Segments, where different threshold values of concern may be needed


## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites and Assumptions

The steps in this document assume you can generate bearer tokens for a UAA client with the `healthwatch.read` (`GET` only) and `healthwatch.admin` (both `GET` and `POST`) scopes. For detailed instructions on how to add these scopes, see [Update Default Alert Thresholds](../installing.html#update-alert-thresholds) in _Installing Pivotal Healthwatch_.


## <a id='info'></a> Healthwatch API Status

To test the availability of the Healthwatch API, send a `GET` request to the `/info` endpoint:

```
curl https://healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/info
```

Where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the system domain URL configured in the TAS for VMs tile. For example, `sys.example.com`.

The expected response is a `200`/`OK` with the message `"HAPI is happy"`.

### GET /v1/free-chunks

To view a list of free chunk configurations, send a `GET` request to the `/v1/free-chunks` endpoint:

```
uaac curl https://healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/v1/free-chunks
```

Where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the URL configured in the TAS for VMs tile. For example, `sys.example.com`.

This returns a JSON array of free chunk configurations:

<pre class="terminal">
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "deployment": "healthwatch-default",
    "value": 4096,
    "type": "memory"
  }
]
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: the value returned in the Pivotal Healthwatch API is in megabytes, but the Pivotal Healthwatch UI displays the value in gigabytes.</p>


## <a id='post'></a> Create or Update Free Chunk Configurations

### POST /v1/free-chunks

To create or update a free chunk configuration, make a `POST` request to the `/v1/free-chunks` endpoint with the following structure:

```
uaac curl -X POST "https://healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/v1/free-chunks" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data "{\"value\":VALUE, \"deployment\":\"DEPLOYMENT-NAME\",\"type\":\"FREE-CHUNK-CONFIGURATION-TYPE\"}"
```

Where:

- `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the system domain URL configured in the TAS for VMs tile. For example, `sys.example.com`.

- `FREE-CHUNK-CONFIGURATION-VALUE` is the value of the free chunk configuration you want to set.

- `FREE-CHUNK-CONFIGURATION-TYPE` is the free chunk configuration type you want to set. You must set the `type` property to either `memory` or `disk`.

- (Optional) `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the name of the deployment for which you want to create or update a free chunk type configuration. If you exclude the `deployment` property, the `POST` request updates the global free chunk configuration.

Possible successful HTTP response codes:

- `200`: A record was updated
- `201`: A new record was created
- `400`: Invalid parameters
