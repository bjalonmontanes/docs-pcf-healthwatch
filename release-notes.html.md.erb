## <a id='releases'></a> Releases

### <a id='2-2-0'></a> v2.2.0

**Release Date:** 1/21/2022

* **[Feature]** In new installations of Healthwatch, the **Routing rules** field in the **Alertmanager** configuration pane is pre-configured with a default
set of routing rules. For more information, see [Default Routing Rules Are Pre-Configured for Alertmanager](#routing-rules-auto-config) below.

* **[Feature]** Healthwatch can automatically configure a route for the Grafana user interface (UI) on Ops Manager foundations with VMware Tanzu Application
Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) installed. For more information, see [Automatic Grafana UI Route Configuration](#grafana-route-auto-config) below.

* **[Feature]** Healthwatch can automatically configure authentication with the User Account and Authentication (UAA) instances in TAS for VMs and VMware
Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) for the Grafana UI. For more information, see [Automatic UAA Authentication Configuration]
(#uaa-auth-auto-config) below.

* **[Feature]** The Grafana UI includes the **System at a Glance** dashboard. For more information, see [System at a Glance Dashboard in the Grafana UI]
(#system-at-a-glance) below.

* **[Feature]** The SVM Forwarder VM emits the `probe_success` and `probe_duration_seconds` metrics into the Loggregator Firehose. For more information, see
[Two Canary Test Metrics Emitted in the Loggregator Firehose](#probe-metrics) below.

* **[Feature]** For Ops Manager v2.10.10 and later, the Prometheus instance scrapes BOSH Director metrics directly from the BOSH Director VM. For more
information, see [Prometheus Scrapes Metrics Directly from the BOSH Director VM](#bosh-director-direct-scrape) below.

* **[Feature Improvement]** Healthwatch uses Grafana v8, which requires a new open source license. For more information, see [Healthwatch Requires New Open
Source License for Grafana v8](#) below.

* **[Feature Improvement]** Healthwatch automatically runs canary tests for the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. For more information, see [Healthwatch
Automatically Runs Canary Tests for the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard](#) below.

* **[Feature Improvement]** Healthwatch automatically configures TKGI cluster discovery by default on Ops Manager foundations that have TKGI installed. For
more information, see [Automatic TKGI Cluster Discovery Configuration](#) below.

* **[Feature Improvement]** You can scale your Grafana, MySQL, and MySQL Proxy instances to `0`. For more information, see [Remove Grafana](#) below.

* **[Feature Improvement]** Dashboards in the Grafana UI that include canary app metrics only show metrics for canary apps that are currently configured. For
more information, see [Grafana UI Dashboards Only Include Metrics for Current Canary Apps](#) below.

* **[Feature Improvement]** The timeouts for the TAS for VMs SLI test suite are increased to five minutes. For more information, see [TAS for VMs SLI Test Timeouts Are Increased](#) below.

* **[Bug Fix]** The TAS for VMs SLI test for the `cf login` command displays success instead of failure upon timeout.

## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

To upgrade from Healthwatch v2.1 to Healthwatch v2.2, see [Upgrading Healthwatch](upgrading-healthwatch.html).


## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features

Healthwatch v2.2 includes the following major features:

### <a id='routing-rules-auto-config'></a> Default Routing Rules Are Pre-Configured for Alertmanager

In new installations of Healthwatch, the **Routing rules** field in the **Alertmanager** pane of the Healthwatch tile is pre-configured with a default set of
routing rules. You can edit these routing rules according to the needs of your deployment.

For more information, see [Configure Alerting](alerting.html#configure) in _Configuring Alerting_.

### <a id='grafana-route-auto-config'></a> Automatic Grafana UI Route Configuration

If your Ops Manager foundation has TAS for VMs installed, you can configure Healthwatch to automatically create a route for the Grafana UI in the **Grafana**
pane of the Healthwatch tile.

For more information, see [(Optional) Configure Grafana](configuring-healthwatch.html#grafana) in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

### <a id='uaa-auth-auto-config'></a> Automatic UAA Authentication Configuration

When you select **UAA** as your Grafana UI authentication method in the **Grafana Authentication** pane of the Healthwatch tile, Healthwatch automatically
configures authentication with the UAA instances in TAS for VMs and TKGI for the Grafana UI. If you want to configure authentication with an external UAA
server, you must select **Generic OAuth** and configure it manually through the **Grafana Authentication** pane.

For more information, see [(Optional) Configure Grafana Authentication](#configuring-healthwatch.html#authentication) in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

### <a id='system-at-a-glance'></a> System at a Glance Dashboard in the Grafana UI

If your Ops Manager foundation has TAS for VMs installed, the Grafana UI includes the **System at a Glance** dashboard. This dashboard displays an overview of
metrics related to the health of your Ops Manager foundation and the runtimes you have installed on that foundation. If your Ops Manager foundation has only
TKGI installed, the Grafana UI does not include this dashboard.

For more information, see [Default Dashboards in the Grafana UI](using-healthwatch.html#dashboards) in _Using Healthwatch Dashboards in the Grafana UI_.

### <a id='probe-metrics'></a> Two Canary Test Metrics Emitted in the Loggregator Firehose

If you deploy the SVM Forwarder VM in the Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs tile, the SVM Forwarder VM emits the `probe_success` and
`probe_duration_seconds` canary test metrics into the Loggregator Firehose.

For more information about canary test metrics, see [Prometheus VM](metrics.html#tsdb) in _Healthwatch Metrics_. For more information about the SVM Forwarder
VM, see [(Optional) Configure Resources](configuring-exporter-tas.html#resource-config) in _Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs_.

### <a id='bosh-director-direct-scrape'></a> Prometheus Scrapes Metrics Directly from the BOSH Director VM

For Ops Manager v2.10.10 and later, the Prometheus instance scrapes BOSH Director metrics directly from the BOSH Director VM instead of the Loggregator
Firehose. This allows the Prometheus VM to gather more types of metrics related to the health of the BOSH Director. These metrics appear in the **Director
Health** dashboard in the Grafana UI.

For more information about the BOSH Director metrics that the Prometheus instance scrapes, see [BOSH SLIs](metrics.html#bosh-sli) in _Healthwatch Metrics_.

### <a id='grafana-8'></a> Healthwatch Requires New Open Source License for Grafana v8

Healthwatch uses Grafana v8, which requires the Affero General Public License (AGPL).

For more information about the AGPL, see [GNU Affero General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) on the GNU site. For more
information about Grafana v8, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v8-0/).

### <a id='cluster-discovery-auto-config'></a>

Healthwatch automatically configures TKGI cluster discovery by default on Ops Manager foundations that have TKGI installed.

### <a id='om-canary-test-auto-config'></a>

Healthwatch automatically runs canary tests for the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard. designed to reduce log bloat on the Ops Manager VM.

### <a id='zero-grafana-mysql-proxy-instances'></a>

You can scale your Grafana, MySQL, and MySQL Proxy instances to `0`.

### <a id='canary-health-check-timeout'></a>

The timeouts for the TAS for VMs SLI test suite are increased to five minutes to reduce false positives.

### <a id='current-canary-apps'></a>

Grafana dashboards that include canary app metric only show metrics for canary apps that are currently configured. no longer displaying outdated
data.
