## <a id='2-0-6'></a> v2.0.6 (Beta)

**Release Date: Feb 11, 2021**
<div class="note breaking">
    <strong>Breaking Changes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a configuration checkbox for skipping SSL validation for the Ops Manager Canary URL.
      Previously, Healthwatch would always skip SSL validation when checking the status of the Ops Manager Canary URL.
      Now, the default is to not skip SSL validation.
      This checkbox will need to be checked if Ops Manager has been configured with self-signed certificates.
      </li>
      <li>Add a default scrape config for scraping metrics from RabbitMQ.
      Previously, this scrape config needed to be added manually in the Healthwatch tile configuration.
      Now, the RabbitMQ scrape config will automatically be generated if "Enable RabbitMQ dashboards"
      is checked in the Healthwatch tile configuration.
      If there is a manually defined scrape config for RabbitMQ in the Healthwatch tile configuration,
      it will need to be removed.
      </li>
    </ul>
</div>

### Feature Deprecations

Healthwatch 2.0.6 will be the last version to emit metrics with the following patterns: `pks_*` and `pas_*`.
Healthwatch 2.0.6+ emit these metrics as `tkgi_*` and `tas_*` respectively.

### Features

* Add high availability Alertmanager and Prometheus.

* Add MySQL tile monitoring dashboard.

* Add automatically generated RabbitMQ scrape config when RabbitMQ Grafana dashboards are enabled.

* Updated RabbitMQ dashboards.

### Resolved Issues

* TAS/TKGi dashboards will not be provisioned when set to "Disabled" in the Healthwatch tile configuration. Fixes <a href="#tas-tkgi-dashboards-provision-when-disabled">TAS/TKGi Dashboards Provisioned When set to Disabled in the Healthwatch Tile Configuration</a>.

* TAS/TKGi dashboards will be deleted when set to "Disabled" in the Healthwatch tile configuration. Fixes <a href="#tas-tkgi-dashboards-not-removed-when-disabled">TAS/TKGi Dashboards are not Removed When set to Disabled in the Healthwatch Tile Configuration</a>.

* Healthwatch will continue to monitor TKGi clusters even if their Master Node is shut down. Fixes <a href="#tkgi-dropped-clusters">TKGi Clusters are not Monitored When Master Node is Shut Down</a>.

* PKS Cluster Discovery will now report the correct node count with NSX-T. Fixes <a href="#pks-cluster-discovery-nsxt-node-count">PKS Cluster Discovery reports incorrect node count with NSX-T</a>.

* Healthwatch no longer fails to deploy when the Alertmanager webhook receiver configuration `bearer_token` property is set.

### Packaged OSS Components

| Component    | Packaged Version |
|--------------|------------------|
| Prometheus   | 2.21.0           |
| Grafana      | 7.3.4            |
| Alertmanager | 0.21.0           |

## <a id='2-0-5'></a> v2.0.5 (Beta)

**Release Date: Nov 6, 2020**
<div class="note breaking">
    <strong>Breaking Changes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Prometheus Alertmanager replaces Grafana alerts. Any edited or custom alerts you have
      will not be transferred. Custom alerts will remain in Grafana alerts and can be manually
      moved to Alertmanager
      </li>
      <li>Update Certificate Expiration alert threshold from 14 days to 30 days</li>
    </ul>
</div>

### Features

* Add Alertmanager (as a replacement for Grafana alerts), including transferring of
existing alerting rules. For more information on alerting rules, see [Alerting](https://docs.pivotal
.io/healthwatch/2-0/common-configurations/alerting.html) to view all alerting rules.
* Add support for TAS 2.10, TKGI 1.8, and TKGI 1.9
* Add Subject Alternative Name (SAN) to all mTLS certificates

### Resolved Issues

* Fix issue discovering TKGI clusters in NSX-T

### Known Issues

* <a href="#pks-cluster-discovery-nsxt-node-count">PKS Cluster Discovery reports incorrect node count with NSX-T</a>.

* <a href="#tas-tkgi-dashboards-provision-when-disabled">TAS/TKGi Dashboards Provisioned When set to Disabled in the Healthwatch Tile Configuration</a>

## <a id="issues"></a> Known Issues

Healthwatch v2.0 includes the following known issues:

### <a name="upgrade-from-om-23"></a> Ops Manager pre v2.3 upgrade issue

When upgrading the Healthwatch v2.0 tile on a foundation that has been upgraded from
Ops Manager v2.3 or earlier, you may see the following error:

<pre class="terminal">
- Unable to render templates for job 'opsman-cert-expiration-exporter'. Errors are:
  - Error filling in template 'bpm.yml.erb' (line 9: Can't find property '["opsman_access_credentials.uaa_client_secret"]')
</pre>

This issue is resolved in Ops Manager v2.8.

To resolve this issue in Ops Manager v2.7 or earlier:

1. SSH into your Ops Manager VM.

1. Change the user to `root`.

1. Open the Rails console by running:

    ```
    > cd /home/tempest-web/tempest/web; RAILS_ENV='production' TEMPEST_INFRASTRUCTURE='DEPLOYMENT-IAAS' TEMPEST_WEB_DIR='/home/tempest-web' SECRET_KEY_BASE='1234' DATA_ROOT='/var/tempest' LOG_DIR='/var/log/opsmanager' su tempest-web --command 'bundle exec rails console'
    ```
    Where `DEPLOYMENT-IAAS` is either `google`, `aws`, `azure`, `vsphere`, or `openstack`, depending on the IaaS of your Ops Manager deployment.

1. Set the decryption passphrase by running:

    ```
    irb(main):001:0> EncryptionKey.instance.passphrase = 'DECRYPTION-PASSPHRASE'
    ```
    Where `DECRYPTION-PASSPHRASE` is the decryption passphrase you want to set.

1. Update the UAA restricted view access client secret by running:

    ```
    irb(main):001:0> Uaa::UaaConfig.instance.update_attributes(restricted_view_api_access_client_secret: SecureRandom.hex)
    ```

1. Exit the Rails console and restart the `tempest-web` service by running:

    ```
    irb(main):001:0> exit
    > service tempest-web restart
    ```
### <a name="tkgi-dropped-clusters"></a> TKGi Clusters are not Monitored When Master Node is Shut Down

When you use PKS Cluster Discovery with TKGi,
clusters are no longer monitored if the Master Node is shut down.
Upgrade to 2.0.6+ to resolve this issue.

### <a name="pks-cluster-discovery-nsxt-node-count"></a> PKS Cluster Discovery Reports Incorrect Node Count with NSX-T

When you use PKS Cluster Discovery with PKS deployed on vSphere NSX-T,
the count of PKS masters is always 1.
When the PKS API creates the cluster on NSX-T,
it also creates a load balancer in front of the PKS Control Plane nodes,
which prevents Healthwatch from addressing each node separately.
Upgrade to 2.0.6+ to resolve this issue.

### <a name="pks-cluster-discovery-nsxt-ports"></a> PKS Cluster Discovery needs manual configurations on NSX-T.

When PKS Cluster Discovery is used with PKS deployed on vSphere NSX-T, the load balancer created by NSX-T
does not have all the ports open that are required for PKS Cluster Discovery to scrape from on-demand PKS clusters correctly.
One workaround is to manually modify the load balancer through the NSX-T Manager API to open the
`10200`, `10251`, `10252`, and `8443` ports.

To open the ports:

1. Fetch the list of virtual servers by running:

    ```
    curl -u 'NSX-T-USERNAME:NSX-T-PASSWORD' \
      "https://NSX-MGR-IP-OR-FQDN/api/v1/loadbalancer/virtual-servers" | jq .
    ```
    Where:
    - `NSX-T-USERNAME` is the username you use to log in to the NSX-T console.
    - `NSX-T-PASSWORD` is the password you use to log in to the NSX-T console.
    - `NSX-MGR-IP-OR-FQDN` is the IP address or fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your NSX-T console.

1. In the output, look for the JSON array item that has the `display_name` starting with `lb-pks`
       and ending with `virtual-server` and copy the `id` field.

1. Fetch the current configuration for the load balancer by running:

    ```
    curl -u 'NSX-T-USERNAME:NSX-T-PASSWORD' \
      https://NSX-MGR-IP-OR-FQDN/api/v1/loadbalancer/virtual-servers/VIRTUAL-SERVER-UUID
    ```
    Where:
    - `NSX-T-USERNAME` is the username you use to log in to the NSX-T console.
    - `NSX-T-PASSWORD` is the password you use to log in to the NSX-T console.
    - `NSX-MGR-IP-OR-FQDN` is the IP address or fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your NSX-T console.
    - `VIRTUAL-SERVER-UUID` is the unique ID that identifies the load balancer.

1. Save the JSON that is returned by this command to a file.

1. Modify the JSON file to include the additional ports:

    ```
    {
        "...": "...",
        "ports": [
            "8443",
            "10200",
            "10251",
            "10252"
        ],
        "...": "..."
    }
    ```

1. Send a PUT request to the API to update the virtual server by running:

    ```
    curl -X PUT -u 'NSX-T-USERNAME:NSX-T-PASSWORD' \
      https://NSX-MGR-IP-OR-FQDN/api/v1/loadbalancer/virtual-servers/VIRTUAL-SERVER-UUID \
      -H 'X-Allow-Overwrite: true' -H 'Content-type: Application/json' \
      -d 'MODIFIED-JSON-DATA'
    ```
    Where:
    - `NSX-T-USERNAME` is the username you use to log in to the NSX-T console.
    - `NSX-T-PASSWORD` is the password you use to log in to the NSX-T console.
    - `NSX-MGR-IP-OR-FQDN` is the IP address or fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your NSX-T console.
    - `VIRTUAL-SERVER-UUID` is the unique ID that identifies the load balancer.
    - `MODIFIED-JSON-DATA` contains the additional ports you want to add.

### <a name="usage-service"></a> Usage Service Dashboard alerts on early patches of TAS.

When Healthwatch is installed with TAS for VMs versions v2.7.17 and earlier patches, v2.8.11 and earlier patches, or v2.9.5 and earlier patches,
the **Usage Service** Dashboard will not be populated correctly and will trigger alerts tagged with `usage_service_app_usage_event_cc_lag_seconds`.
One workaround is to pause reporting these alerts by opening **Grafana** -> **Alerting** -> **Alert rules**, and pause the corresponding alerts.

### <a name="tas-mysql"></a> TAS MySQL dashboard alerts when external MySQL is configured.

When Healthwatch is installed with TAS for VMs with external MySQL, the provided MySQL dashboard will alert.
Upgrade to 2.0.4+ to resolve this issue.

### <a name="empty-blackbox-url"></a> Healthwatch fails to install when no canary url is provided.

When there is no canary url provided, Healthwatch renders an invalid configuration file results failure in Apply Changes.
To workaround this issue, provide at least one canary url in the target urls configuration.
Upgrade to 2.0.4+ to resolve this issue.

### <a name="tas-tkgi-dashboards-provision-when-disabled"></a> TAS/TKGi Dashboards Provisioned When set to Disabled in the Healthwatch Tile Configuration

When Healthwatch is installed with the TAS/TKGi "Version to Monitor" options set to "Disabled",
the dashboards would show up in Grafana anyway.
Upgrade to 2.0.6+ to resolve this issue.

### <a name="tas-tkgi-dashboards-not-removed-when-disabled"></a> TAS/TKGi Dashboards are not Removed When set to Disabled in the Healthwatch Tile Configuration

When Healthwatch is installed with the TAS/TKGi "Version to Monitor" options set to anything other than "Disabled",
the appropriate dashboards are installed.
Afterwards, when Healthwatch is configured with TAS/TKGi "Version to Monitor" set to "Disabled",
the TAS/TKGi dashboards would not be deleted and would continue to show up in Grafana.
Upgrade to 2.0.6+ to resolve this issue.
