## How to run the docs locally
1. Clone the docs layout repository into your workspace:

```
cd ~/workspace
git clone git@github.com:pivotal-cf/docs-layout-repo.git
```

1. Follow the instructions in https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/bookdocker,
   with the following modification:

    1. Before you copy `bookdocker` into your path,
    manually edit the Dockerfile configuration inside the `bookdocker/bookdocker` script
    from `FROM ruby:2.3` to `FROM ruby:2.4`
    so that it works with the gems we have in `docs-pcf-healthwatch`.

1. `cd` into `docs-book-healthwatch` and edit the `config.yml`
    1. Under the `sections:` comment out the docs branch that you are not currently working on.
       This is needed to have `bookdocker watch` work as expected.

       **Note:** Don't commit this file.
1. Run `bookdocker watch` in `docs-book-healthwatch` folder,
   and you will get local preview under: `http://127.0.0.1:4567/platform/healthwatch/<VERSION>/installing.html`
   If it doesn't work, run it again, and again... and if that doesn't work, ask for help in the #pcf-docs Slack channel.
