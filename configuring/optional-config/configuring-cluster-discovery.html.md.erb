This topic describes how to configure Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI) cluster
discovery in Healthwatch.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview of TKGI Cluster Discovery

In the **TKGI Cluster Discovery Configuration** pane of the Healthwatch tile, you can enable
the Prometheus instance to detect Kubernetes clusters created by the TKGI API and create scrape
jobs for them. You only need to configure this pane if you have foundations with TKGI installed.

To collect TKGI metrics and view them in the Grafana UI, you must also install and configure
the Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI on your foundations with TKGI installed. To install the Healthwatch
Exporter for TKGI tile, see [Installing a Tile Manually](../../installing/installing-manually.html).
To configure the Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI tile, see [Configuring Healthwatch Exporter
for TKGI](../configuring-exporter-tkgi.html).


## <a id='configure'></a> Configure TKGI Cluster Discovery

To configure TKGI cluster discovery:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.

1. Select **TKGI Cluster Discovery Configuration**.

1. Under **Enable TKGI Cluster Discovery**, select one of the following options:
    * **Disabled:** This option disables TKGI cluster discovery. TKGI cluster discovery is
    disabled by default.
    * **Enabled:** This option enables TKGI cluster discovery and reveals the configuration
    fields described in the steps below.

1. For **Scrape Port**, enter a port where the Healthwatch tile exposes an endpoint from which
the Prometheus instance scrapes metrics detailing the health of the TKGI cluster discovery
process. These metrics appear in the **Healthwatch - Exporter Troubleshooting** dashboard in
the Healthwatch tile.

1. For **TKGI API Address**, enter the TKGI API domain you configured in the **API Hostname
(FQDN)** field in the **TKGI API** pane of the TKGI tile. For example, `api.tkgi.example.com`.
For more information, see [TKGI API Authentication](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/api-auth.html)
in the TKGI documentation.

1. For **TKGI UAA Client**, enter one of the following options for the TKGI UAA client username:
    * Enter the TKGI management admin client username `admin`.
    * Create a separate UAA client with access to the TKGI API and enter the client username
    you specify. For more information, see [TKGI API Authentication](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/api-auth.html)
    in the TKGI documentation.

1. For **TKGI UAA Client Secret**, enter one of the following options for the TKGI UAA client
secret:
    * Enter the TKGI management admin client secret:
      1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
      1. Click the **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition** tile.
      1. Select the **Credentials** tab.
      1. Click **Link to Credential** next to **Pks Uaa Management Admin Client**.
      1. Record the value of `secret`.
      1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
      1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.
      1. In the **TKGI Cluster Discovery Configuration** pane, enter the client secret you
      recorded from the **Credentials** tab in the **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition**
      tile into **TKGI UAA Client Secret**.
    * Create a separate UAA client with access to the TKGI API and enter the client secret
    you specify. For more information, see [Grant Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition
    Access to a Client](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/manage-users.html#uaa-client) in _Managing
    Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Users with UAA_ in the TKGI documentation.

1. If you configured UAA as the OIDC provider for TKGI in the **UAA** pane of the TKGI tile,
enter the TKGI UAA admin password in **TKGI UAA Admin Password**. Otherwise, do not configure
this field. For more information, see [Grant Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Access
to a Client](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/manage-users.html#uaa-client) in _Managing Tanzu
Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition Users with UAA_ in the TKGI documentation.

1. For **Test Frequency in Seconds**, enter in seconds how frequently you want the TKGI service
level indicator (SLI) test to run. The TKGI SLI test monitors the health of the TKGI API by
logging into the TKGI API server, listing all TKGI clusters, and logging out of the TKGI API
server.

1. (Optional) To enable TLS communication between Healthwatch and the TKGI API, configure one
of the following options:
    * To configure Healthwatch to use a self-signed CA or a certificate that is signed by a
    self-signed CA when communicating with the TKGI API over TLS, provide the CA in **TKGI
    API Certificate Authority**. If you provide a self-signed CA, it must be the same CA that
    signs the certificate in the TKGI API.
    * If you do not provide a self-signed CA or a certificate that is signed by a self-signed
    CA in the **TKGI API Certificate Authority** field, you can enable the **TKGI API Skip
    SSL Validation** checkbox to enable Healthwatch to skip SSL validation when connecting
    to the TKGI API. VMware does not recommend skipping SSL validation in a production environment.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition** tile.

1. Select **Host Monitoring**.

1. Under **Enable Telegraf Outputs?**, select **Yes**.

1. Enable the **Include etcd metrics** checkbox to send etcd server and debugging metrics to
Healthwatch.

1. For **Setup Telegraf Outputs**, provide the following TOML configuration file:

    ```toml
    [[outputs.prometheus_client]]
          listen = ":10200"
    ```
    You must use `10200` as the listening port to enable the Prometheus instance to scrape
    Telegraf metrics. For more information about creating a configuration file in TKGI, see
    [Create a Configuration File](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/monitor-etcd.html#toml) in _Configuring
    Telegraf in TKGI_ in the TKGI documentation.

1. Click **Save**.

1. For each plan you want to monitor:
  1. Select the plan you want to monitor. For example, **Plan 2**.
  1. For **(Optional) Add-ons - Use with caution**, enter the following YAML snippet to configure
  the roles required to enable the Prometheus instance to scrape metrics from your TKGI clusters:

      <%= partial '../../snippets/cluster_scraping_config.md' %>

      If **(Optional) Add-ons - Use with caution** already contains other API resource definitions,
      append the above YAML snippet to the end of the existing resource definitions, followed
      by a newline character.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Select **Errands**.

1. Ensure that the **Upgrade all clusters** errand is enabled. Running this errand propogates
the add-on resources provided in each plan to on-demand clusters.

1. Click **Save**.
