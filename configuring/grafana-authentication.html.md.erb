This topic describes how to configure different authentication methods for users to log in
to the Grafana UI.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview of Grafana Authentication

By default, users log in to the Grafana UI using basic authentication. With basic authentication,
all users log in to the Grafana UI using the username `admin` and the admin login credentials
found in the **Credentials** tab of the Healthwatch tile.

However, you can configure the Grafana UI to use a different authentication method instead.
This allows users to use their own credentials to log in to the Grafana UI.

The sections in this topic describe how to configure different authentication methods for users
to log in to the Grafana UI:

* Basic authentication. For more information, see [Configure Basic Authentication](#configure-basic-auth)
below.

* Generic OAuth. For more information, see [Configure Generic OAuth Authentication](#configure-generic-oauth)
below.

* User Account and Authentication (UAA). For more information, see [Configure UAA Authentication]
(#configure-uaa) below.

* LDAP. For more information, see [Configure LDAP Authentication](#configure-ldap) below.

For a list of Grafana-supported authentication integrations, see the [Grafana documentation]
(https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/overview/).

The values that you configure in the **Grafana** pane also configure their corresponding properties
in the Grafana configuration file. For more information, see [Overview of Configuration Files
in Healthwatch](config-file-reference.html#overview) in _Configuration File Reference Guide_,
[Configuring the Grafana Configuration File](config-file-reference.html#grafana) in _Configuration
File Reference Guide_, and the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/configuration/).


## <a id='configure-basic-auth'></a> Configure Basic Authentication

When you configure basic authentication for the Grafana UI, all users log in to the Grafana
UI using the username `admin` and the login password found in the **Credentials** tab of the
Healthwatch tile. If Basic Authentication is disabled, users will not be able to log in with
the admin credentials.

To configure basic authentication and obtain the login password for the Grafana UI:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.

1. Select **Authentication**.

1. Under **Basic Authentication (username and password)**, select **Enable**.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Select the **Credentials** tab.

1. In the **Admin Login Password** row of the **Grafana** section, click **Link to Credential**.

1. Record the value of `password`. This value is the password that all users must use to log
in to the Grafana UI.


## <a id='configure-generic-oauth'></a> Configure Generic OAuth Authentication

When you configure generic OAuth authentication for the Grafana UI, users can log in to the
Grafana UI with their credentials for the Grafana-supported OAuth provider of your choice.
For more information about configuring generic OAuth authentication, see the [Grafana documentation]
(https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/generic-oauth/).

To configure generic OAuth authentication for the Grafana UI:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.

1. Select **Authentication**.

1. Under **Additional Authentication Methods**, select **Generic OAuth**.

1. For **Provider name**, enter the name of your OAuth provider.

1. For **Client ID**, enter the client ID of your OAuth provider. The method to retrieve this
client ID differs depending on your OAuth provider. To find the client ID of your OAuth provider,
see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/overview/).

1. For **Client secret**, enter the client secret of your OAuth provider. The method to retrieve
this client secret differs depending on your OAuth provider. To find the client secret of your
OAuth provider, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/overview/).

1. For **Scopes**, enter a comma-separated list of scopes that the OAuth provider adds to the
user's token when they log in to the Grafana UI. These scopes differ depending on your OAuth
provider. To find the scopes for your OAuth provider, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/overview/).

1. For **Authorization URL**, enter the authorization URL of the server for your OAuth provider.

1. For **Token URL**, enter the token URL of the server for your OAuth provider.

1. For **API URL**, enter the API URL of the server for your OAuth provider.

1. (Optional) For **Email attribute**, enter the attribute that contains the email address
of the user. For more information, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/generic-oauth/).

1. For **Grafana domain**, enter the domain of the Grafana instance. You must configure this
field if your OAuth provider requires a callback URL that uses the root URL of the Grafana
instance. If your OAuth provider does not require a callback URL, do not configure this field.

1. To allow new users to create a new Grafana account when they log in with their existing
OAuth credentials for the first time, activate the **Allow new accounts with existing OAuth
credentials** checkbox. This checkbox is activated by default. Deactivating this checkbox prevents
users without a pre-existing Grafana account from creating a new Grafana account or logging
in to the Grafana UI with their existing OAuth credentials.

1. (Optional) For **Allowed domains**, enter a comma-separated list of domains. Configuring
this field limits Grafana UI access to users who belong to one or more of the listed domains.

1. For **Allowed teams**, enter a comma-separated list of teams. Configuring this field limits
Grafana UI access to users who belong to one or more of the listed teams. Configure this field
if your OAuth provider allows you to separate users into teams. If your OAuth provider does
not allow you to separate users into teams, do not configure this field.

1. For **Allowed organizations**, enter a comma-separated list of orgs. Configuring this field
limits Grafana UI access to users who belong to one or more of the listed orgs. Configure this
field if your OAuth provider allows you to separate users into orgs. If your OAuth provider
does not allow you to separate users into orgs, do not configure this field.

1. For **Allowed groups**, enter a comma-separated list of groups. Configuring this field limits
Grafana UI access to users who belong to one or more of the listed groups. Configure this field
if your OAuth provider allows you to separate users into groups. If your OAuth provider does
not allow you to separate users into groups, do not configure this field.

1. (Optional) To allow the Grafana instance to communicate with the server for your OAuth provider
over TLS:
  1. For **Certificate and private key for TLS**, provide a certificate and private key for
  the Grafana instance to use for TLS connections to the server for your OAuth provider.
  1. For **CA certificate for TLS**, provide a certificate for the certificate authority (CA)
  that the server for your OAuth provider uses to verify TLS certificates.
  1. If you do not provide a self-signed CA certificate or a certificate that is signed by
  a self-signed CA certificate, activate the **Skip TLS certificate verification** checkbox.
  When this checkbox is activated, the Grafana instance does not verify the identity of the
  server for your OAuth provider. This checkbox is deactivated by default.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='configure-uaa'></a> Configure UAA Authentication

When you configure UAA authentication for the Grafana UI, users can log in to the Grafana UI
with their credentials for the UAA instance of the runtime that is installed on the same foundation
as the Healthwatch tile, either VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) or Tanzu
Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI). When authenticating to an external UAA server, use the fields
described in [Configure Generic OAuth Authentication](#configure-generic-oauth).

To configure UAA authentication for the Grafana UI:

1. Select **UAA** under **Additional Authentication Methods**.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='configure-ldap'></a> Configure LDAP Authentication

When you configure LDAP authentication for the Grafana UI, users can log in to the Grafana
UI with their LDAP credentials. You can also create mappings between LDAP group memberships
and Grafana org user roles. For more information about configuring LDAP authentication, see
the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/auth/ldap/).

To configure LDAP authentication for the Grafana UI:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile.

1. Select **Authentication**.

1. Under **Additional Authentication Methods**, select **LDAP**.

1. For **Host address**, enter the network address of your LDAP server host.

1. (Optional) For **Port**, enter the port for your LDAP server host. The default port is `389`
when the **Use TLS** checkbox is activated, or `636` when the **Use TLS** checkbox is deactivated.

1. (Optional) To allow new users to create a new Grafana account when they log in with their
existing LDAP credentials for the first time, activate the **Allow new accounts with existing
LDAP credentials** checkbox. This checkbox is activated by default. Deactivating this checkbox
prevents users without a pre-existing Grafana account from creating a new Grafana account or
logging in to the Grafana UI with their existing LDAP credentials.

1. (Optional) To allow the LDAP server to communicate with the Grafana instance over TLS when
authenticating user credentials, activate the **Use TLS** checkbox. This checkbox is deactivated
by default.

1. (Optional) To allow the LDAP server to run the `STARTTLS` command when communicating with
the Grafana instance over TLS, activate the **Use STARTTLS** checkbox. This checkbox is deactivated
by default.

1. (Optional) To allow the Grafana instance to skip TLS certificate verification when communicating
with the LDAP server over TLS, activate the **Skip TLS certificate verification** checkbox.
This checkbox is deactivated by default.

1. (Optional) For **Bind DN**, enter the distinguished name (DN) for binding to the LDAP server.
For example, `cn=admin,dc=grafana,dc=org`.

1. (Optional) For **Bind password**, enter the password for binding to the LDAP server. For
example, `grafana`.

1. (Optional) For **User search filter**, enter a regex string that defines LDAP user search
criteria. For example, `(cn=%s)`.

1. (Optional) For **Search base DNs**, enter an array of base DNs in the LDAP directory tree
from which any LDAP user search begins. The typical LDAP search base matches your domain name.
For example, `dc=grafana,dc=org`.

1. (Optional) For **Group search filter**, enter a regex string that defines LDAP group search
criteria. For example, `(&(objectClass=posixGroup)(memberUid=%s))`.

1. (Optional) For **Group search base DNs**, enter an array of base DNs in the LDAP directory
tree from which any LDAP group search begins. For example, `ou=groups,dc=grafana,dc=org`.

1. (Optional) For **Group search filter user attribute**, enter a value that defines which
user attribute is substituted for `%s` in the regex string you entered for **Group search filter**.
You can use the value of any property listed in **Server attributes** below. The default value
is the value of the `username` property.

1. (Optional) For **Server attributes**, enter in TOML format tables of the LDAP attributes
that your LDAP server uses. Each table must use the table name `[servers.attributes]`.

1. (Optional) For **Server group mappings**, enter in TOML format an array of tables of LDAP
groups mapped to Grafana orgs and roles. Each table must use the table name `[[servers.group_mappings]]`.
For more information, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/ldap/#group-mappings).

1. (Optional) To allow the Grafana instance to communicate with your LDAP server over TLS:
  1. For **Certificate and private key for TLS**, provide a certificate and private key for
  the Grafana instance to use for TLS connections to your LDAP server.
  1. For **CA certificate for TLS**, provide a certificate for the CA that your LDAP server
  uses to verify TLS certificates.

1. Click **Save**.
